# Innovative Library



    This project can manage the books, journals and DVD's stored in a database through a webApp.
    To make it easier to search for any artifact, it is used a searching tool in order to speed the searching process. 
    
    About responsabilities we are going to divide the project by classes, we don't have fixed responsabilities but we are going to try to develop half of the classes each one and always working together to make it easy.
    
    Week 1 - In the first week we are going to setup everything for the project.
    Week 2 - After the setup we are going to create all the classes we will need.
    Week 3 - In the third week we are going to implement those classes
    Week 4 - In the fourth week we are going to fix some bugs that may appear during the development, and try to find things we can add to improve the project.
